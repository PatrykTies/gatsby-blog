Secondly , there will be global reward for everyone. Small workships flying , loaded with GEC, from 50 - 1000 per kill !! Some guys said they made 20.000 GEC only by killing those !

I think we can win only by defending our territories. Opponents know, if they don't attack us, they will loose. We control bigger numbers of stars, thanks to DROP team safe zone removal.

Here is the score board for alliance stars :

Above screen shows territories per alliance.

If we will need to attack we will do so by attacking their weaker alliances , like so:

Those weak alliances are all 4mil and less players. Most inactives.

It will be fun !
