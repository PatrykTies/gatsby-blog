We think they will attack us first.  Saturday 17:05 CEST be ready and announce in global chat if you see them jumping inside the rift area, like so :

Rift zone on the map :

Rift zone, view from inside :

Enemies will be colored RED and ALL of our galaxy players will be BLUE, friendly.

Dont worry , combine forces and play together, you wont be able to attack each other.

VII, DRP, ODP join forces.

Also, don't talk important stuff in global chat during war time, global chats will merge.

Only alert if you see enemies.
