This tank design is awesome, we killed 3mil , 5mil, 3mil pirates in one go just using ONE tank like this. And loses were maybe 30% only. Expensive and long to repair tho. Must accompany it with +20 evasion admiral, that's for sure....best to be legendary too.

The design :

That design and research at lvl5 lab give 94 to evasion , plus admiral +20, it is 114 evasion , no cannon weapons can target it , drones have problems too....only missiles and laser can reach this unit , lol

and the evasion admiral , it is important.

This type of tank is mostly used in wars, when we need to break enemy lines, at stabilisation for example....we send it first to take the heavy fire and attacking fleets move behind , good game.
