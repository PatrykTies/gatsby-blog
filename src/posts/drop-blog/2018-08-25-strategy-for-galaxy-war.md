Our strategy consist two parts. One defensive mode and counter-attack mode.

We will defend at first, using enemy arrogant approach, we trap them at warp stabilization. Kill one by one as they will be spread by jump times. 

All players must watch Rift zones all the time. And inform in ally chat **\- NOT IN GLOBAL CHAT -**

**War plan:**

**Each big alliance is responsible for defending their closest Rifts, VII and ODP**

**If none around you, or if they attack from different place - JUMP AND HELP OTHERS.**

1. ** at 17:02 CEST today, SMX players jump in multiple locations, at least from 2-3 Rifts.**
2. **17:05 we spotted them moving out in to outpost direction**
3. **once they enter warp , and first 3-5 fleets exit warp and stabilize - our 10 players jumps at them and rape them apart , **
4. **they retreat, another 10 players jump at their stations same time, that are parked in Rift - if not shielded...they might use shields,**
5. **we repeat this strategy until enemy looses his tempo, momentum**
6. **at 19:00 CEST is all over for tonight.**
7. **at 21:00 CEST we counter attack with all we got, attacking weakest alliances of 186.**
8. **during the night we use shields for every alliance**
9. **8:00 am CEST Sunday, I think SMX will attack us again**
10. **we repeat defending strategy.**
11. **We have much more systems under control from get go, so they must occupy our space or loose.**



I wish you all a good game !
