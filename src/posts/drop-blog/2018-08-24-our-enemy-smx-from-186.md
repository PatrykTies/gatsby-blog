Knowing enemy is half the success. I know them. They are arrogant and think we are an easy target - we must use that against them. I saw it happen in 141 server galaxy war. Where group of 5 players killed all 20 players fleets on stabilisation. I show you how they did it here.

We can win by only defending, they control much less number of stars.

They have few big players, biggest threat is the guy named Transition and SkyFlakes. I think SCHATTEN is mostly paying for his game, so no skill. Uncle-DD created 20 alts and playing solo.

I observed them for past 2 months.

Their alliance is only lvl12 , nothing special.

SMX alliance equal in many shapes with DROP. We have great chances in defeating them!!
