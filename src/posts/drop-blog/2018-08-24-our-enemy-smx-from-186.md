Knowing enemy is half the success. I know them. They are arrogant and think we are an easy target - we must use that against them. I saw it happen in 141 server galaxy war. Where group of 5 players killed all 20 players fleets on stabilisation. I show you how they did it here.

We can win by only defending, they control much less number of stars.
