Alloy is important for big ships and krakens , we must scan only Gas planets, 3 hour scan of Gas planet give Alloy field , it spawns in the same system after "New civilisation discovered" scan scenario. You must press GREEN answer each time.

Locate your station in systems that have 2 or 3 Gas planets inside. And keep on scanning them.

Like so:
