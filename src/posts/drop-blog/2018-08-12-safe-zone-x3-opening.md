Sunday 12th Aug 18, we finally open big safe zone. Hoping to get Fly1000 and remaining VI rebels killed. Read more about strategy for this night. I hope many member will join us in bloodbath...

1. We gather 20:30 CEST at the Evaxus system as our starting point.
2. We split into 2 groups, RED and BLUE , RED is for biggest fleets x 12, BLUE for smaller fleeters.
3. RED team go first, IDEFIX WILL TANK IT FIRST=>

   4. BLUE team go as second after RED kills above outpost. BLUE team kill 812k pirate and outpost at the Olbers system =>

   5. RED team recall after kill, and jump stations to Rovannic. Reason being , I did kill the Gravity Trap already, but only from south side entrance. So we must go around and enter through south. ZOOHR WILL TANK IT ALL, TWO TANKS READY, Like so =>

   6. Within 1 hour we should clean it, after that kill them all !!! 

   7. RULES FOR TONIGHT: Idefix and Zoohr get all resources from outpost kills, as they tanked     it. 85 raynors will die and more....at those 4 mil pirate.
