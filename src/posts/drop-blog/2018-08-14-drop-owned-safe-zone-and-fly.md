Finally, thanks to Idefix's great Evasion Tank design, we both provided amazing tanking for our members. Who came together, yet again, to conquer this universe....Great job !!

Started at 21 CEST , took us some time to gather up in Evaxus. 

Hantares, Cheubo, free69, Warlegion, BAAAM, Idefix and Zoohr finaly attacked huge group of pirates defending the HQ. Group of 3.2 mil x 2 and 5.4mil x 1 were destroyed in minutes ^^

So HQ went down and opened whole new space for us....and access to those pesky rebels from VI with Fly1000 the defiler as main target.

Fly1000 before :
